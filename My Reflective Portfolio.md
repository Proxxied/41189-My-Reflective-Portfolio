# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

During the first week of this subject, I have been introduced into the world of systems, most specifically the human orientated, complex systems. I have learnt that complex systems behave in varying ways, due to the key attributes, boundaries, and characteristics of each system.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The fact that each complex system possesses key attributes which dictate the elements, relationships, and function of a system. Essentially, a system is more detailed and complex than I originally thought, most notably the differences between a complex, complicated, chaotic, and obvious system. And how there are varying levels and measurements of complexity for a particular system.

### What insights have I gained?

That each system possesses their unique attributes and characteristics leading to the differing measurements in complexity, which in turn dictates the overall outcome and output of a system.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths and weaknesses vary day to day, however during the workshop I noticed that it was easy for me to understand the content of the workshop when paired with a definition, example, and comparison of a particlar concept. However, I tend to lose track during a lecture if I get side-tracked with distractions around me, especially if lecture slides are not provided prior to the class.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As previously mentioned, I tend to get side-tracked often if I get distracted, so a fundamental challenge for me personally, would be to adjust my learning and to adapt to this new environment.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would need to focus on the developing content rather than unnecessary and rather irrelevant things during a lecture in order for me personally, to understand the content at hand, which will in turn, pull greater results.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As mentioned previously, examples and theories found within the lecture futher assist in my learning. One theory is that systems, complicated and complex do not mean the same thing, rather four different categories to which systems adbide by: complex, complicated, chaotic, and obvious.
