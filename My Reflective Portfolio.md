# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

During the first week of this subject, I have been introduced into the world of systems, most specifically the human orientated, complex systems. I have learnt that complex systems behave in varying ways, due to the key attributes, boundaries, and characteristics of each system.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The fact that each complex system possesses key attributes which dictate the elements, relationships, and function of a system. Essentially, a system is more detailed and complex than I originally thought, most notably the differences between a complex, complicated, chaotic, and obvious system. And how there are varying levels and measurements of complexity for a particular system.

### What insights have I gained?

That each system possesses their unique attributes and characteristics leading to the differing measurements in complexity, which in turn dictates the overall outcome and output of a system.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths and weaknesses vary day to day, however during the workshop I noticed that it was easy for me to understand the content of the workshop when paired with a definition, example, and comparison of a particlar concept. However, I tend to lose track during a lecture if I get side-tracked with distractions around me, especially if lecture slides are not provided prior to the class.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As previously mentioned, I tend to get side-tracked often if I get distracted, so a fundamental challenge for me personally, would be to adjust my learning and to adapt to this new environment.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would need to focus on the developing content rather than unnecessary and rather irrelevant things during a lecture in order for me personally, to understand the content at hand, which will in turn, pull greater results.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As mentioned previously, examples and theories found within the lecture futher assist in my learning. One theory is that systems, complicated and complex do not mean the same thing, rather four different categories to which systems adbide by: complex, complicated, chaotic, and obvious.

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?

For the second week of this subject, I have learnt how to better understand models in particular, complex adaptive systems and the overall science of these types of models. This new found understanding is backed up by the theories explored during the lecture in order to provide informal content to the participants.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Not only did I learn about the content about complex adaptive systems, but also the science behind them, including the theorems of *Diversity Prediction Theorem*, and the *Condorcet Jury Theorem*. And also understanding the seven uses of models, i.e. REDCAPE.

### What insights have I gained?

An insight that I have gained is the fact that complex systems use the Wisdom Hierarchy in order to decipher the *many model thinking* including the knowledge, information, and data behind each individual model.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

In the second week, my strengths and weaknesses are still very much the same as the previous noting that it was easy for me to understand the content of the workshop when paired with a definition, example, and comparison of a particlar concept. However, I tend to lose track during a lecture if I get side-tracked with distractions around me, especially if lecture slides are not provided prior to the class.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As previously mentioned, I tend to get side-tracked often if I get distracted, so a fundamental challenge for me personally, would be to adjust my learning and to adapt to this new environment.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would need to focus on the developing content rather than unnecessary and rather irrelevant things during a lecture in order for me personally, to understand the content at hand, which will in turn, pull greater results.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

By far the most useful theory is the *Diversity Prediction Theorem* or better known as the wisdom of the crowd, where different opinions and ideas about a particular topic can influence the resulting outcome of a model (if done correctly).

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?

This week was very interesting, as the lecture went through important takeaways such as the difference between rational, behavioural and rule-based attributes, whilst undertaking the fundamentals of how people can add value and power, solve problems as a team, and how individuals can potentially reveal and conceal information.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I knew the basic fundamentals of how one could potentially act under pressure or vise-versa in terms of decision making, and behavioural traits, however, I now know these aspects of the human behaviour in higher detail, especially with the help of the signaling model.

### What insights have I gained?

The main insight I have gained after the lecture was how to successfully approach a problem with a more viable solution in a team environment, which is the pairing of both diverse perspectives with diverse heuristics. A key takeaway from the session is the model of problem solving and innovation: *Perspectives --> Heuristics --> Team Diversity --> Recombination = Innovation*.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

During this session I noticed that my mindset to learn and grow is ready to undertake any task at hand, however, considering that the next few assessment tasks are group related, I can be socially difficult to work with, especially with people whom I have never worked with. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I guess the main challenge I have encountered and observed from this session is the undeniable element of mathematics found within the lecture slides and throughout the course. Personally, I'm not a big fan of math in general, however I can easily ask my team for future assistance with them if and when required to.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

As mentioned above, I can quite easily ask my team for future assistance which will work vise-versa if they need any help within the scope of this subject, with the resulting factor of successfully passing the subject and potentially achieving high results.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As mentioned previously, the most beneficial theorem for this week is the signaling model, or most notably the *Costly Signaling Theory* which not only peaked my interest, but also helped in my understanding of human actions and emotions, proving that each action has meaning, or in other words, costliness carries meaning.
