# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

During the first week of this subject, I have been introduced into the world of systems, most specifically the human orientated, complex systems. I have learnt that complex systems behave in varying ways, due to the key attributes, boundaries, and characteristics of each system.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The fact that each complex system possesses key attributes which dictate the elements, relationships, and function of a system. Essentially, a system is more detailed and complex than I originally thought, most notably the differences between a complex, complicated, chaotic, and obvious system. And how there are varying levels and measurements of complexity for a particular system.

### What insights have I gained?

That each system possesses their unique attributes and characteristics leading to the differing measurements in complexity, which in turn dictates the overall outcome and output of a system.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My strengths and weaknesses vary day to day, however during the workshop I noticed that it was easy for me to understand the content of the workshop when paired with a definition, example, and comparison of a particlar concept. However, I tend to lose track during a lecture if I get side-tracked with distractions around me, especially if lecture slides are not provided prior to the class.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As previously mentioned, I tend to get side-tracked often if I get distracted, so a fundamental challenge for me personally, would be to adjust my learning and to adapt to this new environment.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would need to focus on the developing content rather than unnecessary and rather irrelevant things during a lecture in order for me personally, to understand the content at hand, which will in turn, pull greater results.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As mentioned previously, examples and theories found within the lecture futher assist in my learning. One theory is that systems, complicated and complex do not mean the same thing, rather four different categories to which systems adbide by: complex, complicated, chaotic, and obvious.

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?

For the second week of this subject, I have learnt how to better understand models in particular, complex adaptive systems and the overall science of these types of models. This new found understanding is backed up by the theories explored during the lecture in order to provide informal content to the participants.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Not only did I learn about the content about complex adaptive systems, but also the science behind them, including the theorems of *Diversity Prediction Theorem*, and the *Condorcet Jury Theorem*. And also understanding the seven uses of models, i.e. REDCAPE.

### What insights have I gained?

An insight that I have gained is the fact that complex systems use the Wisdom Hierarchy in order to decipher the *many model thinking* including the knowledge, information, and data behind each individual model.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

In the second week, my strengths and weaknesses are still very much the same as the previous noting that it was easy for me to understand the content of the workshop when paired with a definition, example, and comparison of a particlar concept. However, I tend to lose track during a lecture if I get side-tracked with distractions around me, especially if lecture slides are not provided prior to the class.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As previously mentioned, I tend to get side-tracked often if I get distracted, so a fundamental challenge for me personally, would be to adjust my learning and to adapt to this new environment.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I would need to focus on the developing content rather than unnecessary and rather irrelevant things during a lecture in order for me personally, to understand the content at hand, which will in turn, pull greater results.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

By far the most useful theory is the *Diversity Prediction Theorem* or better known as the wisdom of the crowd, where different opinions and ideas about a particular topic can influence the resulting outcome of a model (if done correctly).

---

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?

This week was very interesting, as the lecture went through important takeaways such as the difference between rational, behavioural and rule-based attributes, whilst undertaking the fundamentals of how people can add value and power, solve problems as a team, and how individuals can potentially reveal and conceal information.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I knew the basic fundamentals of how one could potentially act under pressure or vise-versa in terms of decision making, and behavioural traits, however, I now know these aspects of the human behaviour in higher detail, especially with the help of the signaling model.

### What insights have I gained?

The main insight I have gained after the lecture was how to successfully approach a problem with a more viable solution in a team environment, which is the pairing of both diverse perspectives with diverse heuristics. A key takeaway from the session is the model of problem solving and innovation: *Perspectives --> Heuristics --> Team Diversity --> Recombination = Innovation*.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

During this session I noticed that my mindset to learn and grow is ready to undertake any task at hand, however, considering that the next few assessment tasks are group related, I can be socially difficult to work with, especially with people whom I have never worked with. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I guess the main challenge I have encountered and observed from this session is the undeniable element of mathematics found within the lecture slides and throughout the course. Personally, I'm not a big fan of math in general, however I can easily ask my team for future assistance with them if and when required to.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

As mentioned above, I can quite easily ask my team for future assistance which will work vise-versa if they need any help within the scope of this subject, with the resulting factor of successfully passing the subject and potentially achieving high results.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As mentioned previously, the most beneficial theorem for this week is the signaling model, or most notably the *Costly Signaling Theory* which not only peaked my interest, but also helped in my understanding of human actions and emotions, proving that each action has meaning, or in other words, costliness carries meaning. 

---

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

After the conclusion of this week's class, I was able to understand the three different ways to model complex adaptive systems, that of through system dynamics models, network models, and agent-based models. For the entire duration of the lecture, I was keen to learn and understand differing versions of this topic, however what peaked my attention the most was the concept of casual loop diagrams (CLD), as it essentially provides a visual and graphical representation of relationships between different variables, whether categorised as a reinforcing loop (two positives) and a balancing loop (a positive and a negative). As part of the system dynamics models, CLD in my opinion would be critically useful considering that it can graphically provide instantaneous information about the variables in question, which is why this model especially, peaked my interest.

### What insights have I gained?

In addition to what I mentioned above, another topic that peaked my interests in the lecture, which further provided additional insights was actually a video played, which provided a visual demonstration of agent-based modelling working with simple rules in order to learn and essentially create a "hide and seek" simulation, whereby at each intervals, the agents were able to learn and adapt new techniques to improve their overall playstyle, which to be honest, suprised me simply because I did not expect said agents to adapt to these new techniques so uniquely and how, at some intervals with adding more objects and obstacles, the agents were able to manipulate and adapt to these changes in order to successfully complete their objective.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

After this week's lecture, it struck me that due to the fact that I experienced learning about the networking models during high school, I can practically apply my knowledge onto real life scenarios through the networking model whenever possible, however I have realised that some models require additional logic and further mathematics in order to apply and explain said models, which could potentially affect the way I learn and understand new concepts.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

A notable challenge I encountered and obverved was when I attempted to learn more about the Python programming language which is associated with the upcoming assignment, however most times when trying to understand basic code within the language, I felt that it could potentially clash with the language of Java, since I'm also learning that programming language at the same time in another subject of mine, so I need to learn how to balance and differentiate between the two more efficiently.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

As mentioned above, I need to essentially balance the workload for myself to understand and differentiate between the programming languages of Java and Python in order to assist myself and my team with the upcoming assignment for this subject, and additionally for my other subject's assessment tasks in relation to the Java programming language. For this subject in particular, as soon as I equally balance each language effectively, the better it will be for me and my team to complete the assignment at hand.

## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Reflecting on this week's lecture and subsequent new found knowledge and understandings of probability and distributions, including the normal distribution. It is clear cut that week 5 is all about interpreting and accurately predict patterns and trends about a particular characteristic of a system, which can potentially be used to portray the life expectancy of a system and surrounding outcomes. What really caught my attention was the long-tailed distrubition, which was a completely new concept for me personally, which arise due to feedbacks and interdependencies leading to a further increase of inequities, which is clearly undesirable. 

### What insights have I gained?

A key, fundamental insight I have gained through this week's lecture was the preferential attachment model, which is essentially portrays the links between different objects or people through a very unique perspective. It was confusing at first, however given some thought, it depicted that a particular person can easily influence the decisions of the following group members. Which confusing enough, can be explained through this sentence: *the probability of joining a particular entity equals its size divided by the number of arrivals to date.*

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

A key observation I have made is the fact that I can easily understand the fundamental concepts of probability and further varying distributions, especially regarding the characteristics of normal distribution which I have previously learnt in high school, however a key weaknesses that I observed is the fact that if and when mathematics or an equation is used to explain a particular topic or model, it can potentially affect the way I interpet that topic, which is something I definitely want to work on improving.


### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

This week's topics were especially interesting to me, simply due to the fact that the theory of the *Central Limit Theorem* peaked my interest the most, probably because of the functions of the *Galton Board* which is a mechanical tool used to accurately display a binomial or normal distribution through a physical medium. This theorem is essentially in a nutshell, a model for aggregation of decisions in groups of people which I have learnt especially through the Qantas example used that +-1 SD (standard deviation) includes 68% of possible outcomes, +-2 SD includes 95% of possible outcomes, and +-3 SD includes 99% of possible outcomes. In terms of the Qantas example previously mentioned, assume a typical Boeing 747-400 type aircraft can hold exactly 380 seats with a 90% turn up rate (average number of people showing up is 360) (SD = 6) resulting in 354-366 = 68%, 348-372 = 95%, and 342-378 = 99% of the time. Therefore: 99% of the time, the aircraft will never become overbooked. 

---

## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

As part of this week's tutorial, new topics were explored for me personally, including the Markov models, random walk models, and the concepts of broadcast, diffusion, and contagion models in understanding how these complex systems evolve over a period of time. I've also learnt in particular, that the random walks model can be used to assist in identifying a probable outcome, and in this case, the example used was illustrated with a drunk man whether or not he will fall of the cliff. Through the use of a probability tree, the eventual outcome was that it was generally a mathematically bad idea to be drunk and standing near a cliff. Nonetheless, it was also in my best interest to key into a fundamental theorem of the *Granovetter Threshold Theory* which is in a nutshell, a way of representing a probable cause to an action through individual thresholds when exceeded (more on this later).

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

After today's lecture, it was clear that I had notable strengths in understanding and interpreting the random walks model, which was heavily assisted through the use of the summary video represented within the class, however I also noticed that prior to the summary video, I did have some initial struggles in understanding the concepts, probably because I was distracted with the various graphical representations within the slides, but definitely got back on track after the video was initiated.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As part of the upcoming assignment, it was clear that I needed to interact with my team more clearly, especially since the due date was by the end of week eight, so definitely identifying a topic now was extremely necessary. Thankfully though, after various back and forth conversations that were mostly off topic banter, we set a group leader and further agreed upon a relevant topic, which was the overall problems associated with new, upcoming social media platforms, including how they grow and become adopted within the surrounding community.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

The primary improvement I could personally do better with is to manage my time efficiently and effectively, more or less to set sub-tasks with due dates before the primary task is due. This would not only help myself mentally via less overall stress, but probably boost my commitment to the subject, which to be honest is a bit of a lackluster all together. However there is still room for improvement, with the ultimate goal of achieving the highest grade possible.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

As mentioned previously, the theory that proved to not only be the most useful, but also the most interesting out of the bunch was definitely the *Granovetter Threshold Theory* which was explained through the use of 'riots'. Basically, each individual has their own personal thresholds, that if exceeded, will essentially perform a particular resulting action, which in this case, is joining a riot. Individuals with low thresholds are more susceptible to rioting compared to people with higher thresholds, which are only likely to riot if there is a substantial number of rioters on the field. This theory is useful because I can personally see a visual representation of this in today's society, with the context of town a containing people of lower thresholds far susceptable to rioting or actions that represent wrong doings. In Australia in particular, the country can be represented as town b, with people of higher thresholds whom are more reserved individuals, which therefore prevents riots from starting in the first place.

## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

As part of this week's lecture content, I have been able to understand in much greater detail the concepts of emergent behaviours, including peer effects / social contagion, coordination / culture, and social learning. And a deeper analysis into the Standing Ovation Model, Granovetter's Riot Model, and Schelling's Segregation Model which without a doubt, helped me understand and apply that newfound knowledge into our group's assignment. In terms of what I now know that I didn't know before hand was through the perspective of the games theory (pure coordination games), culture can be modelled as a series of pure coodination games which alludes to the fact that the opinions of others sways the group leading to a segregation or diverse outcome.

### What insights have I gained?

As mentioned before in previous weeks, modelling through Schelling's segregation model has significantly assisted my understanding in terms of human behaviour and characteristics, as people tend to follow a certain rule in order for them to group up and form communities. In order to map this behaviour through this model, it is clear that people with similar interests tend to group up, whilst others with opposing interests, stray away from each other. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

A definite known strengths is my application to understand and interpret these models into real life scenarios, for example the segregation model is evident through varying friend groups and communities, whereas my weaknesses is applying said knowledge through a mathematical format, which can slow down my learning quite notably. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

In order to combat these challenges mentioned this weeks and the previous, myself and my team have contributed to the pre-submission assignment in small fragments at a time, in order to overcome the potential of poor time management that may result in lower standards of our report. This not only pushed us to perform in the task, but also indirectly helped us to better understand each other in terms of our strengths and weaknesses in regards to this subject in general. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The most useful theory as part of this week's content was undoubtly Schelling's Segregation Model and the use of the NetLogo application to better understand how to map this model from my own perspective. This model can be used and applied to as part of my group's upcoming pre-submission assignment, however this theory proved to be more useful to myself rather than my group, which could potentially affect if the segregation model will be applied in the aformentioned assignment.

---

## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

This week was a heavy week for myself and my team, especially since the pre-submission was due at the end of this week. Because of this, I have learnt in detail how to best use the Jupyter Notebook application in detail in order to complete the task at hand using the Jupyter format, which to be honest, was really difficult at first since I haven't had any previous experiences with the application however, with the help of my team, we finalised and submitted the Github repository with succession. In terms of this week's learning content, I have learnt about the concepts of the Colonel Blotto Model and the Prisoners Dilemma Model, which are both part of the game theory models which essentially depicts an individual's effective reasoning behind the psychological decision making that each party processes with.

### What insights have I gained?

A notable insight I have gained from this week's content is the Prisoner's Dilemma model, which provides an assumed outcome through the 'best possible scenario' frame of mind, however what it misses out on is the fact that the best possible scenario for both agents are almost never chosen, because of the fact that human beings as a whole, is not only difficult to predict, but also nearly impossible to psychologically determine the choices and decisions the other agent is processing without actually communicating with them. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

As alluded to in the opening paragraph of this week's reflection, a notable weakness that I have observed is to effectively use the Jupyter software efficiency and effectively as part of this upcoming assignment, despite this however, I have sinced learned how to use the program in order to complete the task at hand which consequently contributed to the resulting performance myself and my teammates did.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the challenges that I encountered and observed was the fact that some of my teammates had not previously used the Jupyter Notebook application before, which actually resulted in editing the master file directly using the Github website. This resulted in the master file becoming corrupted due to an input of incorrect code injected into said master file. This meant that our team leader had to revert the file to an older version which actually slowed us down, so we decided to allow a select number of members of the team to directly edit the file through Jupyter at each interval in order to prevent any problems or issues.


### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Despite the Prisoner's Dliemma having caught my attention this week, I believe that the Colonel Blotto game was the most useful theory, as it can be practically established to anyone and essentially push each individual / agent to becoming a better overall individual. Leveling up the playing field per se, contributes to everyday life whereby balancing each aspect, for example in the form of time management, the overall outcome of completing university effectively is a mixture of equilibrium and chaos. This is simply due to the fact that the Colonel Blotto game provides us with the understanding that from an individual standpoint, regardless of skill or luck, can still complete the task at hand.

## Week 9

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Week 9 and onwards are structured a bit differently than the previous weeks, with no new content to learn about, however as part of this week's lecture task, we were required to provide feedback to other members of the subject alongside my teammates. This meant that we also received valuable feedback that was related to the pre-submission assignment task last week, more on this later. In addition to that task, another team member of our group further offered to myself and other inexperienced Jupyter Notebook users a chance to get to know the code in more detail, which without a doubt helped greatly in the continuation of this upcoming final assignment.

### What insights have I gained?

As mentioned previously, a fundamental insight I have gained this week was the very valuable feedback provided to our group as part of this week's task, which was to offer reasonable and appropriate feedback to other groups within this subject. We were kindly offered a few issues and recommendations that required attention, including the introduction and further body paragraphs. Feedback like this help pushed our group to succession in order to complete the task at hand.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

A definite weakness I have seen is my ability to manage my time efficiently and effectively, that meaning of actually taking the time to contribute to this assignment rather than focusing on other subjects due to the fact of "being lazy" as an example of an excuse. However, a known strength of mine is the ability to actually do work effectively, if and when my team requests something of me, I do it. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

A definite challenge is the lack of motivation I have at this current time, probably because of all the assignments that I have with other subjects, or maybe that our group is currently 'crawling' through this subject. But we at least talk and plan about the assignment, which is one way we handle the situation.

---

## Week 10

### What insights have I gained?

As part of this week's tasks, my group have further discussed as a team about the issues brought to our attention from the peer review task in the previous week. This allowed us to become motivated to do better and thus, actually make some progress with team building and sub-tasks completion. I have without a doubt further enhanced my understanding of the overall language of Python and Jupyter in general, at least to the extent of this subject's assignment. But it still hasn't been a smooth ride, more on this later. Aside from that rambling, a valuable insight I have gained is a better understanding of the models we are using for our group's assignment. This is mainly because at the pre-submission stage of the assignment, I contributed more on the initial stages of the Github repository, including the introduction section, and the context, backgound information, and justification section of the project. The team assisted my understanding on the System Dynamics model, Networks, and Replicator Dynamics model which will be further explored as part of our final assignment.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

As mentioned earlier, a known weakness I have at the current time is my personal ability to differentiate between Java and Python, because unfortunately I keep becoming  confused between the two programming languages, which to be honest, isn't affecting my ability to complete this subject's assignment, but more on affecting my other subject more or less due to the differing codes. Nonetheless, a definite strength is bouncing back and improving my work efficiency for the benefit of my group, because I do not want to be the 'anchor' of our team.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges observed were through internal issues regarding the applications and prerequisites needed for our team to pursue with the assignment. This problem is mainly focused on the Jupyter Notebook in terms of successfully porting images and visual representations of the content as part of our assignment. This was resolved through a quick tutorial by another team member on how to port images using a third party website 'Imgur' in order to host images that can be used in our Notebook.

---

## Week 11

### What insights have I gained?

This week granted a two week extension to the deadline, lightening the load our group has with the final Github submission, allowing our team to reform our content and excell our understanding of the task at hand. Another essential benefit for this extension was that I could personally finalise all my assignments from other subjects to later focus on this subject's assignment, pushing for a greater overall report at the end of the day.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

A definite weakness is still grasping my understanding of the entire Python language, but with the help of my team, they essentially guided me on how to use pre-existing code to speed up the process on implementing and formatting the text and images in succession. A perceived strength I have observed was assigning roles for each team member in order to even the load with our members, which directly supports the overall performance and productivity of our team.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

As mentioned previously, this week's workshop provided reasonable evidence that the way I worked with my group was simply unproductive, and I was essentially able to recognise that I could just inject pre-existing code to the report in order to speed up the process, as to a certain extent, the method I used before still worked at the end of the day, but was effectively time consuming and inefficient. So because of this, we as a team were able to adjust to this newfound information and took advantage of it. 

---

## Week 12

### What insights have I gained?

This week was a very unique week simply due to the fact that the workshop was cancelled because Juan decided to kindly let students focus their efforts more on the assignment rather than to potentially waste time in a lecture, which to be honest was a very positive move and actually helped our team in particular to push for success, given that our section three and four have yet to be finalised on the Juypter Notebook. The skipped lecture allowed my group to further explore in detail the models of system dynamics, networks, and replicator dynamics in terms of actually modelling the growth of new social media platforms which is our topic. This week our group has made sound progress in terms of section four in a private document before it will be uploaded on the Juypter Notebook for formatting reasons, yet I believe that we can still finish the task at hand before the due date, which mentioned last week was extended by an extra fortnight.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

A definite weakness I have observed for myself is the fact that time management and time efficiency are still on the weaker side of the spectrum than I honestly rather have it at, but then again shouldn't affect my overall performance for the assignment too much due to the extra time honered by Juan. On the other hand, a known strength that I have observed from myself is that if and when I'm actively working with my team to do a specific task for the assignment, my efforts are not short lived, which I never noticed until now.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

A known challenge that I have encountered was the fact when the team wanted to have a uniform group call at a particular time to obviously discuss the assignment at hand, it was relatively difficult to actually schedule a time when everyone in the group was available, which meant that virtual calling was simply impossible. The team handled this situation as effective as possible, leading to the group members providing important and valuable information in a text format and the not so important comments to be handled virtually. This actually helped productivity and essentially pushed our progress on the task substantially.
